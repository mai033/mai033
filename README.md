### Hi, I'm Dahlia 👋👩🏻‍💻 

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about contributing to open-source projects, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Recently, I had the honor of sharing insights in a public talk on CI/CD as part of the Case Blink Engineering Speaker Series.
